~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* A community-owned network sounds great, but without business incentives, who is going to maintain it?

* As a user, you are part of the "community of owners", which comes with responsibilities

* You need to decide for yourself whether a community network is desirable, or not, because I already have an internet where I can pay $80 a month and stream Netflix all day without the slightest idea of how these pictures show up on my screen (convenience)

* On the other hand, building a meshnet sounds super inconvenient, because we need to build it

* Why I feel the internet is actually kind of sucky, especially in the way we access it, and what a better one could look like

* How internet access works and how else can it work, what are the tradeoffs, so we can have the right discussions and make informed decisions
