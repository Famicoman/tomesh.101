# Facilitator's Guide
## Introduction to networks: From the internet to tomesh.net

A three hour intro to networks workshop. Through hands-on activities and play we will cover basics of:
- how networks like the internet operate
- features and quirks specific to the internet
- alternate forms of networks (like mesh networks) that people can use to connect with each other!

Duration: 3 hours
Date Materials Updated: 2016-07-04

### Goal

Introduce networking concepts in a hands-on, no-tech workshop that is family friendly.

## Materials

Materials needed for the workshop include:
* Easel board paper or large sheets of post it paper
* Markers
* Yarn
* Binder clips
* Scrap Paper
* Tape
* Printed map for "Every Network Tells a Story" activity
* Printed pieces for  "Every Network Tells a Story" activity (pdf available [here](https://commotionwireless.net/files/cck/planning/1-Design_Your_Network_Every_Network_Tells_a_Story.pdf))

The repository is structured as follows:
* `slides/` containing the tomesh version of the presentation, this will have to be adjusted to your needs
* `_files/` with examples of maps ([1](#), [2](#)) that will need to be created for the "Every Network Tells a Story" activity
* `_images/` containing images for presentation and this facilitation guide

## Schedule

1:00 - Workshop Start
1:10 - 1:40 (0:30) I: What we know about computers and the internet
1:40 - 2:30 (0:50) II: How computers talk
2:30 - 2:40 BREAK
2:50 - 4:00 (0:50) III: Networks include people!

## Instructions

### Section I: What we know about computers and the internet

**Goals**:
- Temperature check people's understanding of internet/networks
- Cover what a computer is as a building block to how networks function

#### Intro Icebreaker (5 mins)

1. Begin by introducing yourself  
2. Prompt the group to go around the circle and if desired answer an icebreaker question (e.g., one thing they want to learn in the session)

#### Background with Internet (15 mins)

Modified from networks.land [Seeing the Internet](http://networks.land/activities/see-the-internet/)

1. Walk participants through 2 questions, noting on an easel board sheet: (4 mins)
  - What is the internet?
  - What do use the internet for?

2. Ask participants to break into pairs and draw and answer to the below question (6 mins)
- What do you think happens behind the scenes when you’re using the internet? How does a webpage or an application end up on the screen you’re looking at?

3. Have each group describe what they drew to the rest of the participants (5 mins)

#### Human/Computer Analogy Discussion (10 mins)

Modified from Red Hook Wifi's ["Humans and Computers"](http://redhookwifi.org/the-digital-stewards/)

1. Introduce computers to what a computer does, linking it to how computers operate on a network
> "At a high level, computers do four things: from [software carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/00-intro.html)
  * run programs (process operations/instructions)
  * store data
  * interact with us
  * communicate with each other"

2. Working with an easel board sheet, guide participants through human-computer analogy (materials below)

### Section II: What we know about computers and the internet

**Goals**:
- Identify basic (technical/structural) components of a network
- Make a case for why networks are fundamental and popular

#### Needs / Yields Yarn Toss (10 mins)

1. Introduce activity as a way to think about sharing resources on a network, get group to stand in circle with everyone facing each other

2. With Yarn, introduce yourself and identify a need you have (e.g., I need help installing this piece of software) and a yield (e.g., I have lots of extra stickers). These do not have to be technical or material resource-based. Ask if someone either can help you with your need or would like your yield. When someone does toss the yarn to them holding onto the end

3. Continue to go about participants identifying needs and yields until everyone is in the 'network,' frame discussion back to resources and link to analogy from previous activity on how humans communicate versus computers

#### Embodying a Network Activity (30 mins)

1. Have participants stand up in a circle facing each other, describe activity as simulating sending messages on a network. The mechanics occur through using string, clips with prop messages that participants move around, and scissors to cut connections

2. First create a 'Linear' or 'Path'-based network
  * Show how hops through lead to wanting stability, what if a node goes offline, disconnects from the network)

3. Move participants into a 'Star' network
  * Show how switching of messages on the networks operates
  * Show the star falling apart and being taken offline (e.g., with the prompt of an internet service provider (ISP) going down)

4. At this point as facilitator ask the participants to identify some of the issues they are seeing, you should have pointed out or questioned some of the observations as they've been 'operating' as a network. Ensure that at least the following are covered:
  * privacy, who has my information
  * cost and impact on access (through ISP monopoly?)
  * resiliency or redundancy

could also include:
  * not knowing stuff (network literacy?)
  * agency (censorship?)

5. Move to participants into a 'Decentralized' network (this might be hard to do, depending on size) and check in on the social issues

6. Move to participants into a 'Distributed' network and check in on the social issues. Wrap Up conversation about how this looks like a mesh

## Section III: Networks include people!

**Goals**:
- Show how the human and technical components both are required/interact for a network
- Connect to activities and interest of tomesh

#### Every Network Tells a Story (35 mins)

1. Introduce the game, have a discussion about [game mechanics](https://www.commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/design-your-network-every-network-tells-story/) and location, based on the map you've prepared for the workshop

2. Working from presentation slides ensure you cover the 4 different routers types:
  * Low Power Omnidirectional (All Direction) Router
  * High Power Omnidirectional (All Direction) Router
  * High Power Sector (Directional) Router
  * High Power Focused (Narrow Beam) Router

3. Bring the conversation back to a group discussion (this generally happens about half an hour) and allow for people to reflect and share what they learned from the activity and workshop more generally
