# Why a mesh for Toronto?

We see an opportunity for community-owned infrastructure to give us:

* open, lower-cost **access** to the World Wide Web
* a **resilient** and redundant network
* **agency** to make important decisions about privacy
* **autonomy** to access information in a free manner
* an opportunity to develop **technical literacies** (less 'I don't know')

# Join us!
