~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Business incentive (and right) to maintain control over this huge infrastructural investment they have put in early on

* Black-box this whole thing, users having little visibility and influence over their monopolized platform

* Information access as basic human right, monopoly misaligned with user-interest

# Network topology and ownership #

![topology](topology.gif)

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Number of edges to each node

* Ownership of a link is negotiated between the two nodes (peering)

* Why a mesh? Because the topology is especially well suited to distributed ownership model

# Your internet experience #

How about...?

* Economic conditions -> **Equal levels of access**
* Geographical location -> **No geo-blocking**
* Government policies -> **No self-serving censorship**
* Corporate interest -> **Effect influence aligned with your interests**
* Exclusive memberships -> **Open protocol and FOSS implementations**
